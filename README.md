Python Implementation of KU23: Honest-Majority Threshold ECDSA with Batch Generation of Key-Independent Presignatures

## Intro

Just how good is Gemini 3?  
In this paper, [Honest-Majority Threshold ECDSA with Batch Generation of Key-Independent Presignatures](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2011), Jonathan Katz and Antoine Urban from [Dfns](https://www.dfns.co/) describe an efficient protocol for honest-majority threshold ECDSA supporting batch generation of key-independent presignatures that allow for "non-interactive'" online signing.  

With the release of [Gemini 3](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/), I wanted to test Code-Generation-From-PDF... this repo is the result of this experiment.
